# Create a bash script that, 
# given a path name as argument => we'll call it root
# gets a listing of all subfolder paths recursively => one per line
# then writes lines to console => in markdown format
# where each line has the format: [root-name/folder-name](folder-path)
# e.g. given argument "./bootstrap" => output line example is [bootstrap/album](/bootstrap/album)
