# jQuery UI v1.13.2 Samples

- The [jQuery UI site offers a download](https://jqueryui.com/download/) of their [comprehensive list of demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/) as a standalone folder that can be used for learning from.
- The download offers the option to also specify a preferred theme (including light and dark) and the option to [define a custom theme](https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!) to use with these demos.
- In Oct 2021  jQuery maintainers [announced jQuery UI 1.13 will be the final planned release](https://blog.jqueryui.com/2021/10/jquery-maintainers-update-and-transition-jquery-ui-as-part-of-overall-modernization-efforts/) as they transition to more modern alternatives.
- However the same post also reinforced that  **73% of the top 10M popular sites run jQuery** - something reflected in our analysis of 9K sites.
- With that in mind, this subfolder will be used to host the **1.13.2** version of Demos for our accessibility tests.
