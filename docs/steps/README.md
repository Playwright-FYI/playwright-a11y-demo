# Accessibility Testing With Playwright

This section contains the documentation for replicating the experiments in a consistent way. The content can be repurposed into a workshop or tutorial for either self-guided or instructor-led training. For reusability _this_ section will use GitHub flavored Markdown and no added frameworks, making it possible for us to also use this content as a test target for Markdown-driven static site generation.
